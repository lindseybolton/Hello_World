## Project Title
*Hello_World*

## Description
For this project, I am simply introducing myself to GitHub! This is a project due for my **BAIS Professional Preparation** Class.

## How to Run Program
For this project, I am using the repository and README.md functions on GitHub. I used markdown language for both, and have included my resume in the repository.

## Files Used
[Resume](https://github.com/lindseybolton/Hello_World/files/8181169/Lindsey.Resume.pdf)

## Additional Documentation
No additional documentation.

## Version Summary
I have updated my repository a couple of times, including to add a link to my resume. I have been updating it as I get used to using markdown language, since I haven't had the chance to learn it in my classes quite yet. I'm very excited to learn more about coding! ðŸ™‚
